# Captive Portal - Email Collection
This is a PHP and JavaScript based captive portal that requires only a valid email address for login<br><br>
Each email submitted is marked with date/time and stored with an incremental numeric value.
<br><br>
There are two versions here. One is meant for Ruckus Wireless' Hotspot service (Tested with both Unleashed and ZoneDirector controllers) and one is meant for Ubiquiti Unifi controllers.
